      I take advantage of all opportunities given to me. I attend The Peddie School, which is a boarding school, in Hightstown,
      New Jersey. I love engineering. I started a robotics team in middle school and continued my love since.I aspire to
      become a mechanical engineer and work to do what I love while helping others. Along with participating in robotics
      I play field hockey and lacrosse. My parents are immigrants from Ethiopia. They came to america like many others to
      bring opportunity to my and my brothers.

      has given me a marviouse opportunity as a minority to achieve my goals of going into a field of work that best fits me. It
      also gave me the opportunity to interact and work with people that may share the same or similar goals as me. We also
      had the chance to work and discover a new disease that we may or may not have been aware of. My group choose to study
      toxoplasmosis. I worked on creating the slides and prototype.</p>

      I was raised in West Philadelphia I want to be an become a mechanical engineering entrepreneur, so I am always looking for
      opportunities to learn more about engineering and STEM, reading books and experimenting with toys and monitors in my
      room. I currently attend G.W. Carver high school, where I where I continue to learn in the STEM field. I am participating
      in a summer STEM academy, SMASH@Wharton where I am learning about STEM, marketing, and economics. Iâ€™ve been assigned
      to a team and we have chosen to study Toxoplasmosis.
